### Variable filter 
* Filters are used by the template engine to act on template variables. To use them simply follow the variable with the filter name inside the delimiter and separate them with the | character.
* The character | separating the variable and the filter is called a pipe or vertical bar.
```
{{ variable | filter_name }}
```
